Hey, this is Masterain. Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile. 

I'm a new graduated student from SCU, MS in Information Systems program. I focus on data analysis works, programming is my hobby. Practicality, compatibility, and automation extensibility are things I consider more when designing programs, because what usually drives me to design programs are the boring things in life that need to be done repeatedly. Similarly, standardized processes and automated validation are my approach to managing projects, as I see these as lessons learned and best practices in real action.

I'm currently involved in the DGP-Studio/Snap.Hutao project, responsible for data processing, network design, CI/CD and some of the back-end services used to support the project. UIGF-Org is an extension of the project that standardizes our data model and exposes it to the open-source community, and I'm happy to see it being adopted by some other programs at the moment.
